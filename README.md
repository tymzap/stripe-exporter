# stripe-exporter

Simple tool for exporting Stripe payments in format that I needed. Written using Next.js server routes.

## Getting started

Paste your Stripe private key (needed to authorize API calls) to `.env.local` file and run the app locally.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# run development server
$ yarn dev
```
